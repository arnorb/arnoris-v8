<p>The client has given us a lot of room to work with and find out what fits the best. We did early research interviews with association members to find out what structure would be the best fit. It has taken a bit more time than planned but I know it will be worth it.</p>

<p>A project me and my brother started, this site that is now in hiatus, featured interviews with Icelandic music artists.</p>

<p>Definately a personal project where I had to make all the design decisions myself.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know Japanese, so I had to do quite a bit of research on how the language works and figure out the possibilities. It was pretty fun!</p>
